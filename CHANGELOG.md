# Changelog for `python-spgill-utils` package

## 2.2.0

- I've decided to move the new `spgill.utils.media.*` modules to a brand new package named `python-spgill-media` which [can be found here](https://github.com/spgill/python-spgill-media), and these new modules hence been stripped out of this package. The old deprecated module will still remain until the next major version.

## 2.0.0

- Newly re-written library for interacting with media files, available as `spgill.utils.media.*`. Existing `spgill.utils.mux.*` will be deprecated but will remain until the next major version.
